# Basic SPA (Single Page Application) Demo
This is a very simple little project that I put together for a basic SPA layout. It includes a home, contact, and about page.

Content is loaded via the `fetch()` API and content is inserted into a single `div`. This can be a good starting point and can be expanded upon/scaled up.
