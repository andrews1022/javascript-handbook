# Book List App
This app takes in books submitted by user. Includes Book Title, Author, and ISBN#. I learned to make this alongside Brad Traversey in his YouTube video [JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=7&t=0s) video on YouTube.

### Things I learnt building this project
- Using [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) to use preset Bootstrap themes
- Practice using ES6 Classes
- Further practice with arrow functions
- Introduction to the keyword 'static'
- Introduction to OOP concepts/programming
