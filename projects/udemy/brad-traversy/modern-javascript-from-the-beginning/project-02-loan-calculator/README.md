# Loan Calculator
A basic loan calculator app. 

I learned to build this project as part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

### What I learned building this project:
- Further practice with DOM Manipulation (specifically changing text based on the input value)
- Further practice using the `setTimeout()` function
