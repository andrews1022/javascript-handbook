# Task List
A task list app where users can add/remove and filter tasks of their choice. 

I made this on my own as part of Brad Traversy's [Modern JavaScript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) Udemy Course.

This was the first project in the course, and building it we used what was covered up until then:
- Basic DOM Manipulation
- Using Local Storage
