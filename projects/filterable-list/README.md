# Build A Filterable List With Vanilla JavaScript

This project was created alongside Brad Traversy in his [Build A Filterable List With Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1eW3Oi6uoc&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=7) video.

### Things I learned building this project
- Further practice with:
  - querySelector
  - querySelectorAll
  - getElementsByTagName
  - addEventListener
- Formatting the input value using .toUpperCase()
- Using a for loop to check if any of the names listed match, and then display only those names
