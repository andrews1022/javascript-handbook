# Bookmarker App
A simple application for bookmarking websites. 

I learned to build this project along side Brad Traversy in his [Learn JavaScript By Building A Bookmarker Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIVfDZZeGxM&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX&index=17&t=2077s) video on YouTube.

### Things I learned building this project
- Validate URL entry into a form
- Using local storage to keep bookmarks added/deleted
- Getting items from local storage and resetting local storage when necessary
- Appending cards to the page using template literals
