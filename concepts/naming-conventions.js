// Best practice for naming variables is to use camel case:
var myFavMovieIs = "Goodfellas";

// Variables CANNOT use keywords as variable names:
var var = 2;

// Variables CAN have keywords as part of a word like this:
var myVar = 2;

// But it is best to use meaningful, more detailed/specific variable names
var myFavouriteNumber = 2;

// Variables CANNOT start with a number...
var 123 = 5;

// ...but they CAN contain numbers
var my123 = 5;

// Variables CANNOT include special characters aside from $ and _
var $myDog = 'Buddy'; // Mostly used with jQuery
var _myCat = 'Whiskers'; // Used to declare private variables

// Variables CANNOT include spaces
var my friend = 'Brian'

// Instead, use camel case
var myFriend = 'Brian'
