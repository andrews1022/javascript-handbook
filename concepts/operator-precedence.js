// This is where operator precedence comes into place - which operator is executed first
// The table is ordered from highest (21) to lowest (1) precedence.

// Calculate average fullAge
let ageJohn = currentYear - yearJohnIsBorn;
let ageMark = 35;
let average = ageJohn + ageMark / 2;
console.log('incorrect answer:', average);
// But this is not correct, as the division has a higher precedence

// Therefore it should be written like this:

// Now the ( ) has the highest precedence

// Multiple assignments
let x, y;
x = y = (3 + 5) * 4 - 6; // 8 * 4 - 6 --> 32-6 --> 26
console.log(x, y);
// This works because the assignment operator runs from right to left
// First, y is = 26
// Then x is = to y, also 26
// So that is why we got 26 26 in the console
// This is because of associativity

// More operators
x = x * 2;
x *= 2; // Same as above
console.log(x);

// Increment
x = x + 1;
x++; // Same as above
console.log(x);
// Decrement
x--;
console.log(x);
