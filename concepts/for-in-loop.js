// The for in loop works with OBJECTS
// On the other hand, we have the for of loop, which is for ARRAYS

// ---------- EXAMPLE #1 ----------
// The for in loop allows us to loop over and see a object's properties.
const detailedBasket = { apples: 5, oranges: 10, grapes: 25 };

for (item in detailedBasket) {
  console.log('for in loop on an object:', item);
}
// What do here is enumerating
// Properties in an object in JavaScript are what's known as enumerables
// And an object in JavaScript is enumerable if it allows us to see the properties

// *** NOTE ***
// Consider this array:
const basket = ['apples, oranges, grapes'];

// If we were to use a for of loop on an object
for (item of detailedBasket) {
  console.log(item);
}
// We get an error saying: Uncaught TypeError: detailedBasket is not iterable
// We cannot use an iterable loop on an enumerable object

// But if we run (a for in loop on an array)
for (item in basket) {
  console.log(item);
}
// This works, and we get the index locations
// This also works because underneath the hood you can think of JavaScript arrays like objects.

// You can think of our basket array like this:
basket = { 0: 'apples', 1: 'oranges', 2: 'grapes' };

// ---------- EXAMPLE #2 ----------
// Write a function checkBasket() that lets you know if the item is in the basket or not
amazonBasket = {
  glasses: 1,
  books: 2,
  floss: 100
};

// The function:
function checkBasket(basket, lookingFor) {
  for (item in basket) {
    if (item === lookingFor) {
      return `${lookingFor} is in your basket.`;
    }
  }
  return `That items is not in your basket.`;
}
