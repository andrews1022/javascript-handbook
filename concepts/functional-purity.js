// ----**** FUNCTIONAL PURITY **** ----
// Functional purity is a concept where we say, in order for us to write really, really good programs, we want to avoid side effects and we always want a return
// And what's the power in this? 
// By avoiding side effects and always returning, we create something that we call 'Deterministic' 
// 'Deterministic' means that, no matter what if my inputs, let's say five and ten go through a function, the return value will be always the same.
// Again, the input, whatever we put in the parameters whether it's empty or it has certain parameters, it always returns, even if we run this a thousand times.
// It always returns the same value.
// That's 'Determinism'.

// Again, it is really really good practice to be a top performing developer to have this in mind, of creating functions that minimize side effects and have functional purity.
// What we call 'Determinism', where anything you put into the function it always returns the same thing.
