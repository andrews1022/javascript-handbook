// DOM stands for Document Object Model
// Tree structure of your whole document, HTML tags, etc.

// ---------- SELECTION ----------
// We can take HTML elements and put them into variables and things like that and work them

// In the browser, we have something called the window object
console.log(window);
// The window object is the parent object of the browser
// Remember alert()? That is part of the window object. So this would work as well:
// window.alert('Hi!');
// But since windows is the very top window, we don't actually need to use window. for anything that is in window

// Another important one is localStorage
// This is a way to store stuff in your browser that's part of the window object
// The one we use here is doucment object, which want to use to select things from the document
