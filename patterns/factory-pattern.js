// The factory method is a way of creating an interface for creating objects but we can let subclasses define which classes to instantiate
// And factory methods are often used in applications to manage, maintain, and manipulate collections of objects that are different, but at the same time have many common characteristics
// A good example of that would be a member.
// Let's say some kind of paid membership application or web site where your members may have different types but still have the same properties and methods.

// So that's what we're going to do here.
// We're going to create a member factory that takes a member type in creates a new object based on that type
