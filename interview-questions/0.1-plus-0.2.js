// What does...
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3;
// ...evaluate to?

// It evaluates to
false;

// This is because JavaScript uses 64-bit floating numbers
// So...
0.1 + 0.2;
// ...really equates to
0.30000000000000004;

// A solution to this problem would be to use a function that determines if two numbers are approximately equal by defining a margin of error (epsilon value) that the difference between two values should be less than
const approxEqual = (n1, n2, epsilon = 0.0001) => Math.abs(n1 - n2) < epsilon;
approxEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3); // Returns true
