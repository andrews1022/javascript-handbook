// Explain what a callback is in JavaScript

// A callback is a plain JavaScript function passed to some method as an argument or option
// Some callbacks are just events, called to give the user a chance to react when a certain state is triggered.

// ADDITIONAL ANSWER:
// Callbacks are functions passed in as an argument to another function to be executed once an event has occurred or a certain task is completed
// These are often used in asynchronous code
// For example, event listeners are asynchronous callbacks that are executed once a specific event has occurred
