// 'for await of' allows us to loop through our async/await calls if we have multiple of them just like we are able to using the for of
// So using the for of loop that allowed us to iterate over iterables, we're now able to iterate over the await promises that we're going to have
// Let's create a new function with this in mind:

// First, with the for of loop
const loopThroughUrls = (urls) => {
	for (url of urls) {
		console.log(url);
	}
};

// Now with 'for await of':
const getData2 = async function () {
	// In here we can have an array of promises
	// Because an array of promises is irritable and able to be looped by the 'for await of' keywords
	const arrayOfPromises = urls.map((url) => fetch(url));
	// So here in the first line, all we're doing is creating an array of these fetch promises of each one of these requests (the urls)

	// Next, we can use the 'for await of' loop to loop through these promises
	for await (let request of arrayOfPromises) {
		const data = await request.json();
		console.log(data);
	}
};

// Same funcion but without comments for better readability:
const getData2 = async function () {
	const arrayOfPromises = urls.map((url) => fetch(url));

	for await (let request of arrayOfPromises) {
		const data = await request.json();
		console.log(data);
	}
};
